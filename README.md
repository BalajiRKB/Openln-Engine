## 🎯 Project Title:
Open ln: An AI-Driven Personalized Learning & Goal Tracking System

## 💡 Project Idea:
Open ln is an AI-powered personalized learning platform that acts like a SoloLeveling-style mentor, guiding users from their current knowledge level to mastery — no matter what goal they set (e.g., getting a ₹12 LPA job, becoming a better speaker, learning design, etc.). It adapts based on users' time, learning style, and current level. The platform offers dynamic learning paths, personalized daily challenges (coding tasks, reading, or projects), and tracks progress with ranks from E to S.

Every user starts with a goal, and the AI generates a personalized roadmap with awareness training, skill assessments, and daily missions. Feedback is given after each task, and AI monitors GitHub activity, task submissions, and learning logs to level up the user.

## 🧩 Tech Stack:

- Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- AI: Gemini API (Google AI)
- Auth: Google OAuth
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Deployment: CloudFlare (Frontend), Render (Backend)
